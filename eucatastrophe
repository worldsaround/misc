I propose "eumetastrophe" (juːmɛ'tæstrəfiː). 

The etymology is similar to that of "eucatastrophe": /eu/ meaning "good, well" and /metastrophe/ meaning "change from one thing to another". 

The word "metastrophe" has been borrowed a few times in the past, but it is sufficiently unknown to avoid the risk of being confused with the new term.
